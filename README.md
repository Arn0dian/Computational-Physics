# Trajectory Calculation Script 
-Python Script to calculate and plot the trajectory of a projectile motion with or without air drag effect. Provides with accurate path plot and a csv file with time step of 0.001 sec of the co-ordinates data.

It will be modified constantly to add many other computational features as :
* Interception of two projectiles
* Real world Newtonian Simulation of Projectiles 
* Prediction of projectile path and intercepting it with another projectile or a linear ABM.
* Detection and Prediction of Ballistic missile path
* Rocket Telemetry Calculation 

Technologies and tool used 
- User would need to have Python , NumPy , Pandas , matplotlib and MATLAB installed in order to use the script.
 
How to use ? 
- Simply run the python file trajectory.py. ( If it gives error of module missing , "debug and run" the script. )
